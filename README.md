# 1. What's your favorite video game and why?
Any of the Mario Kart series. They're great because they can be played solo or competitvely. My very favorite part of it is racing against my daughter, although she now routinely beats me soundly!

# 2. What gets your blood pumping?
Spaceflight in general, and human spaceflight in particular . I think it's critical humanity moves beyond the Earth to ensure the long term survival of ourselves and the planet. I've made a good career in STEM and aerospace education at locations such as Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama, the Musuem of Flight in Seattle and the Challenger Space Center in Phoenix. I've also been the Executive Director of the DoD STARBASE Indiana program and currently serve as the Director of Education and Training for NearSpace Education where I lead students in designing and launching cubesat satellites and high-altitude balloons. To date I've taught over 85,000 students, led more than 1,000 simulated space missions and launched 40 high-altitude balloons (with number 41 coming up this Thursday.)

# 3. What are you a snob about? In other words, what are you highly opinionated about or what is something where you think your taste is better than other peoplesâ€™?


# 4. Name a way you changed your environment to make it work for you. This can be a favorite hotkey, any unconventional systems you hooked up or a way you were opinionated about your workflow. Think outside the box!
nope

# 5. This is a screenshot of a balloon's altitude profile. Tell me everything you can about the balloon's life:
go up, come down
